from April 8 to 18. This time period was chosen because it represented a period
of steady state when admissions equaled discharges. Estimates based on the

# Roadmap

The main purpose of this site is to visualize Ottawa-based projections for models performed by other teams.

- Review and update model parameters based on recent published studies. Priories for review:
    - ventilated patients
    - deaths
- Add plot for observed hospital census trend, with estimated doubling time.
