# Ottawa COVID-19 projections

Projections for daily new COVID-19 cases and hospitalizations for residents in the Ottawa area. 

Case projections are created using the [Bayesian SEIR model](https://github.com/seananderson/covidseir) developed by Simon Fraser University. Hospital projections are based on the [Bayesian extension to the CHIME model](https://github.com/pennsignals/chime_sims) developed by the University of Pennsylvania Health System. The figures in this repository, however, can be used to present projections for other models.
