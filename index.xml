      <description>Described below is a brief description of methods, data and model parameters used at 613covid.ca. More detailed information can be found in the accompanying references.
Projection models Data used to create hospital projection models can be accessed at Open Ottawa. See ’COVID-19 cases and deaths`. Data used to create wastewater projection models can be accessed at PHESD.
COVID-19 short-term projections are created using the Bayesian EpiNow2 model developed by the EpiForecasts team.</description>

      <description>Model use There are two main uses of the projections:
Short-term projections (1 to 4 weeks) reflect the current level of COVID-19 transmission and current effectiveness of ongoing COVID-19 prevention and control. Short-term projections the immediate need health care such hospital and critical care services for COVID-19 patients.
 Long-term projections (6 weeks onward) reflect sustain trends in COVID-19 transmissions. Long-term projections are helpful to assess the potential effect of COVID-19 re-opening or the need of increased restrictions to control surges.</description>

      <description>People with covid-19 shed the causative SARS-CoV-2 virus in their stool, regardless of whether they have symptoms, receive a covid-19 test or ever are diagnosed. Thus, in contrast to assessing community covid-19 levels by measuring the number of active cases, which may miss asymptomatic infections as well as be subject to limited test availability, wastewater surveillance consistently captures most of the population with covid-19 given that everyone goes to the washroom.</description>
